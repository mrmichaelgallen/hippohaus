Hack the Dot Portland - Team Tiger

On Thursday, November 12, I went to Hack the Dot Portland hosted by Name.com, Bow Tie and Quick Left. 

The challenge was to develop a site using the domain name hippo.haus and pitch to the judges. My team, the Tigers, was one of five finalist to present our website. 

It was a great experience. Colwyn Fritz Moor and Liz Tom from Popart.com did the heavy lifting on building the site structure. They did a fantastic job.
