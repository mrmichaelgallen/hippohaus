Hack the Dot Portland - Team Tiger

On Thursday, November 12, I went to Hack the Dot Portland hosted by Name.com, Bow Tie and Quick Left. 

The challenge was to develop a site using the domain name hippo.haus and pitch to the judges. My team, the Tigers, was one of five finalist to present our website.
